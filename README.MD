# Economy35
![Banner](./github/banner.png)
**Economy35** is an idle game developed in Java, designed as a school project to implement an example of the *producer-consumer thread model*. In this game, the player takes on the role of a company leader, managing resources, employees, and upgrades to maximize profits and grow the business.

It was developed in Java without using any external libraries beyond those integrated into the language.

## Game Description

The game features a strategic gameplay loop with the following elements:

- **Dynamic inventory**: Machines produce packages, which are transported by employees. Customers purchase packages, generating revenue.
- **Revenue management**: A portion of daily revenue is deducted as taxes. If you fail to meet the minimum threshold, the game ends.
- **Upgrades**: Invest in upgrades to increase product value, speed up production, expand inventory, hire more employees, and more.
- **Day cycle**: Time progresses, triggering specific events at the end of each day.
- **Floor navigation**: Players can move between different floors of the building using an elevator.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Java
- **Graphical interface**: Swing
- **Code structure**: Divided into a custom library (`engine` folder) and the main game.

### Custom Library: `engine`

To simplify development and enhance performance, we developed a custom library containing utilities such as:

- Management of audio, graphics, and resources (`SoundManager`, `GraphicsManager`, `ResourceManager`).
- A node-based system for organizing game objects.
- Detailed documentation and Javadoc (see [engine-docs.md](./engine-docs.md)).

## Installation and Launch

### Requirements

- **Java Runtime Environment**: Version `17.0.9` or higher to run the jar file.
- Windows OS for running the `.exe` file (optional).

### Required File Structure

Ensure the main folder contains the following structure for the game to function correctly:

```
main
├───audio
│   ├───music
│   └───SFX
├───sprites
│   ├───subfolders
└───UI
    └───fonts
economy35.jar / .exe

```

### Download and Launch

1. Download the latest release from the repository) or on itch.io.
2. To start:
    - **Jar**: Double-click or use the command `java -jar economy35.jar` in the console.
    - **Exe**: Run the `.exe` file directly.

### Manual Compilation

To compile the project manually:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Use Gradle to build executable files:
    - `.jar`: `./gradlew build`
    - `.exe`: `./gradlew createExe`

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
src/main/java/org/cup
├── assets           # Resource management (audio, graphics, logic)
    ├── audio        
    ├── compnents    # Nodes that intended to work attached to objects
    ├── objects      # Main game classes (machines, customers, employees, etc.)
    ├── logic        # Classes for thread management and other logic
    ├── managers     # Specialised nodes that can only have one instance
    ├── scenes       # Object containers
    ├── sprites      
    ├── UI           # Handles UI integration such as buttons
├── engine           # Custom library to optimize the development process
├── scenes           # Game scenes (main menu, tutorial, main gameplay)
├── UI               # Custom graphical elements (buttons, labels, panels)
└── Main.java        # Application entry point

```
